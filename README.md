Folder Structure - Policy_Management_System
System Architecture
The project follows a layered structure:

Policy_Management_System/
|
|____ policyholder.py
|____ product.py
|____ payment.py
|____ display_utils.py
|____ export_utils.py
|____ notebook.ipynb
|____ README.md
unzip program using R program

How to Run (Jupyter Notebook)
This program was developed using Jupyter Notebooks.
Open Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
Select the appropriate kernel (Python or R)
Run all cells in the notebook
A CSV file ( 'payment_slips.csv and 'hcc_payment_slips.csv') will be generated as output

Learning Outcome - Payroll Processing System in both Python and R
Control structures ('for', 'if')
Dynamic data generation
Exception handling
Payroll logic implementation
Cross-language comparison (Python vs R)

Learning Outcome - Salary Function
* Control structures ('for', 'if')
* Zipping and unzipping with Python and R, respectively
* Exception handling
* converting strings to NaN
* converting NaN to Null for JSON handling
* Cross-language operations (Python vs R)
* Working with Libraries, and Data Structures

Final Putcome _Policy_ MAnagement _System
Final Outcome
The Policy Payment System is a  fully functional billing lifecycle application demonstrating:
Object-Oriented Programming
Clean Architecture
Dynamic business rules
UI-to-service separation
Real-world invoice and  penalty handling

It is a foundation for a production billing syste
