Payroll Processing System (Python & R)
This project demonstrates a cross-language payroll processing system implemented in both Python and R. The program dynamically generates employee data, applies business rules for classification, calculates payroll deductions, handles exceptions, and exports results to CSV.

Features

500 Dynamically generated employees
Unique employee IDs and names
Salary range: $5000 - $50,000
Gender based employee classification
10% tax calculation  (rounded to 2 decimal places)
CSV output for analysis on reporting
Implemented in both Python and R using best practices

Requirements

Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
Python 3.8+ for Python notebooks
R 4.0+ for R notebooks

How to Run (Jupyter Notebook)

This program was developed using Jupyter Notebooks.
Open Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
Select the appropriate kernel (Python or R)
Run all cells in the notebook
A CSV file ( 'payment_slips.csv and 'hcc_payment_slips.csv') will be generated as output

Learning Outcome

Control structures ('for', 'if')
Dynamic data generation
Exception handling
Payroll logic implementation
Cross-language comparison (Python vs R

Output

Both implementations generate identical CSV: payment_slips.csv and hcc_payment_slips.csv
